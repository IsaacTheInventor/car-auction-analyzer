# Car Auction Analyzer

An AI-powered platform that helps car dealers make fast, data-driven buy-or-pass decisions at live auctions or from online listings.  
Upload or capture vehicle photos, and the system automatically:

1. Identifies the exact make / model / year / trim  
2. Detects and quantifies exterior damage  
3. Estimates parts & labour repair costs from real-time parts pricing sources  
4. Aggregates current market prices across multiple marketplaces  
5. Calculates expected profit and ROI so a dealer instantly knows whether the car is worth bidding on.

## üìå Project Overview

Dealers often have only seconds to decide on a bid.  The Car Auction Analyzer reduces guess-work by combining computer vision, market-data aggregation, and cost analytics in a single workflow:

* Upload or live-capture photos
* Backend pipelines run detection & analysis
* Results are summarised in an easy-to-read report (ROI score, profit range, risk level)
* Data is stored so dealers can compare vehicles or retrain models with their own outcomes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Vehicle Identification | Detect make, model, year, trim from exterior & interior shots |
| Damage Assessment | Computer-vision model highlights dents, scratches, panel gaps, broken lights, etc. |
| Parts & Labour Costing | Maps each damaged component to OEM/aftermarket part numbers and live prices scraped from public parts stores (RockAuto, eBay, etc.). Regional labour rates included. |
| Market Pricing | Scrapes / queries free market sources (Autotrader, Cars.com, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace) and exposes plug-ins for paid APIs (KBB, Edmunds). |
| ROI Analysis | Purchase price + repairs vs. projected retail value = profit margin, break-even, payback period. |
| Reporting & History | PDF/CSV export, comparison dashboard, and data retained for future custom model training. |

## üèó Architecture

```
[React Frontend]  ->  [FastAPI Gateway]  ->  [Analysis Micro-services]
                                      ‚Üò
                                       ‚Üò  [Database & Storage]
```

1. **Frontend (Web v1 / Mobile v2)**  
   ‚Ä¢ React + Vite SPA for uploading photos and viewing analysis.  
   ‚Ä¢ Mobile app (React Native) planned: uses the same API.

2. **Backend API (Python / FastAPI)**  
   ‚Ä¢ Auth, file ingestion, task orchestration, REST + future gRPC endpoints.  
   ‚Ä¢ Celery / Redis for async processing.

3. **AI / ML Services**  
   ‚Ä¢ Pre-trained YOLOv8 / ResNet variants for object & damage detection.  
   ‚Ä¢ Fine-tuning pipeline so each dealer can upload ‚Äúground-truth‚Äù data and create custom models.

4. **Scraping & Data Services**  
   ‚Ä¢ Headless browsers + rotating proxies for auction / parts sites.  
   ‚Ä¢ Market price aggregator service with pluggable adapters (free & paid).

5. **Data Layer**  
   ‚Ä¢ PostgreSQL for structured data, MinIO/S3 for raw images & model artefacts.
