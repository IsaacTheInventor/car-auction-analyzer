## 4. Getting AI API Keys

For full AI functionality, obtain these keys (all have free tiers):

1. **Google Cloud Vision**
   - Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create project â†’ Enable Vision API â†’ Create API key
   - Set as `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY`

2. **Azure Computer Vision**
   - Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
   - Create Computer Vision resource
   - Copy Key and Endpoint to `AZURE_COMPUTER_VISION_KEY` and `AZURE_COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT`

3. **Imagga** (optional)
   - Sign up at [imagga.com](https://imagga.com)
   - Copy API key and secret to `IMAGGA_API_KEY` and `IMAGGA_API_SECRET`

*Note: The app gracefully degrades if some API keys are missing.*

## 5. Verifying Full Deployment

After backend deployment:

1. Open [car-auction-analyzer-isaac.netlify.app](https://car-auction-analyzer-isaac.netlify.app) on iPhone
2. Take 2-3 vehicle photos
3. Tap "Upload for Analysis"
4. You should see:
   - Real vehicle identification (make/model/year)
   - Actual damage detection with severity assessment
   - Real repair cost estimates
   - ROI calculation based on market data

If you see "simulated" results, check:
- Backend logs for errors
- API key configuration
- CORS settings match Netlify URL

## 6. Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Choose Backend**: Deploy using Railway for fastest setup
2. **Obtain Domain**: Point `api.yourdomain.com` to your backend
3. **Monitor Usage**: Watch API quotas on free tiers
4. **Scale Up**: Upgrade plans when traffic increases
5. **Add Features**: Auth, payments, dealer management (future)

# On your VM or deployment platform
git pull origin master
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

**Backup Data**:
- PostgreSQL backups run nightly if using Docker VM
- Use managed database backups on Railway/Render
